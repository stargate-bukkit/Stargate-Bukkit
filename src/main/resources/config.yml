  # By default, StarGate uses a local SQLite database to store its data.

  # If you are running a large server, we recommend using a remote database.
  # Note that such a database is required if you intend on building gates with the 'i' flag.
  useRemoteDatabase: false

# What network will be used when none has been specified? (Max length 12 characters)

# Note that this primarily applies to users with the stargate.create.network node.
# Generally, that node is given to staff (we recommend stargate.create.personal for users).
defaultGateNetwork: central

# What network will StarGate reserve for terminal ('T') portals?
#
# Generally, this feature is used to make a group of portals in spawn known as a 'Terminal'.
# Using this network, players can pay to connect their towns/bases/shops/etc. to the terminal.
