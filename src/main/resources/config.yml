  # By default, StarGate uses a local SQLite database to store its data.

  # If you are running a large server, we recommend using a remote database.

defaultGateNetwork: central

# What network will StarGate reserve for terminal ('T') portals?
#
# Generally, this feature is used to make a group of portals in spawn known as a 'Terminal'.
