# Stargate Version 1.0.0.0
A complete recode of Dinnerbone's Stargate from the ground up, based on Drakia's bukkit port.
> *Ragnarok is calling.... Change is futile*

## Rationale
Stargate is one of the seven oldest, continually developed, plugins within the MineCraft server landscape.<br><br>
Over the years, MineCraft and Stargate went through many iterations; many methods used in the original plugin are no longer optimal. Additionally, some classes have grown to unhealthy sizes, and some have since been duplicated by spigot/paper.<br><br>

Furthermore, StarGate was written by one primary dev; what comments exist are extremely minimal. <br>
As this project has transitioned to a community endeavour, the codebase has become difficult to maintain.<br><br>

The result of the above is an inefficient legacy codebase that is difficult for new users to explore.<br>
For first-time contributors, the plugin has become difficult to modify.

## Approach
- [X] Create a fresh, completely wiped, branch in this repo.
- [ ] Determine everything that the original stargate did, and add it to a [projects page](https://github.com/the-lockedcraft-legacy-organization/Stargate-Bukkit/projects/1)
- [ ] Reach parity with the original
- [ ] Add any additional features suggested by the community.
- [ ] Release as a beta
- [ ] Phase out original release for the new version.
