## Description

Stargate-Bukkit is the original MineCraft portal plugin; it existed for as long as MineCraft server modding has been
feasible!

## History

Originally conceived and written by Dinnerbone, the project is now maintained
by [dozens of individual developers](https://github.com/stargate-bukkit/Stargate-Bukkit/graphs/contributors).<br>
Notable contributions in the Bukkit ecosystem have been made by the project's upstream developers, theDgtl and
PseudoKnight.

In 2021 the project was rewritten by Thorinwasher and EpicKnarvik97; this is that rewrite.

| Stargate's interface is integrated within gameplay; players can create, use, and destroy portals without any commands! | All of StarGate's features are designed to allow for non-admin users to create and manage their own portal networks in a balanced and risk free manner. | By default, StarGate boasts a comprehensive network system, dozens of portal types (flags), and highly configurable behaviours. |
